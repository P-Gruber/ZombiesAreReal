# Zombies Are Real 🧟‍♂️🌌
Step into a Minecraft world where zombies have taken the next evolutionary step! Our mod overhauls their origins and instincts, ensuring every rendezvous is a spine-chilling encounter.

Note: This mod is best used in combination with my other mod, VanillaRemover (https://github.com/P-Gruber/VanillaRemover), which eliminates spawn registries for vanilla creatures, allowing only zombies to spawn.

## Main Features
### Zombie Overhaul
- Freshly Risen Zombies: Say goodbye to vanilla zombies and welcome our custom undead (Note: Mods requiring vanilla zombies may face compatibility issues).
- Sound Mechanism: Zombies are drawn to sounds, including the growls they make when chasing a player, as well as the steps and hits made by players, etc. 
- Dynamic Zombie Attributes: Zombies now possess localized damage systems that impact their speed and attack damage, creating encounters with varying health, attack power, and speed attributes for added unpredictability.
- Sun-Resistant Walkers: Zombies now roam freely in daylight.

### Horde Dynamics
- Stealthy Spawns: Zombies emerge coherently from the landscape, adding an element of surprise.
- The Eastern March: Zombies mysteriously coordinate their movements towards the east.
- Twilight Terrors: Prepare for intense zombie horde invasions at dawn and dusk.

### Player Interactions
- Defensive Moves: Players can use defensive moves like pushing zombies away or sneak to avoid alerting zombies.
- Combat Improved: Players can't hurt zombies with an empty hand, or incoherent items.
- Player Exhaustion: Players become fatigued after extended combat.
- Hard to Escape: Player speed is reduced when walking backward, and they become tired after excessive running or jumping.
- Sound Mechanism: Players make sounds that attract zombies with various actions.

## Supported Versions
